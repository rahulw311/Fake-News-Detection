# Fake-News-Detection
Fake News Detection using CNN's

This is a project on a comparative study between different Machine Learning methods applied for Fake News Detection.

The work in this project includes the use of built-in methods using sklearn vs a scratch implementation using basic Machine Learning libraries like numpy.
For CNN's hyperparameter tuning was performed to evaluate how each of the different factors affected the accuracy of the model and to evaluate the performance-time tradeoff.
